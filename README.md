# Lab/Homework

Read over the code we did today.

Make a very simple mongo database of your choosing - a collection of books, movies, records, animals, ice creams perhaps, suggestive question mark?

Serve up this data in an api.

# Extension

If you feel ambitious, make a ui for your data (no need to use models) - this will involve making an XMLHttpRequest to your API and then handing the response to a function that renders everything to screen
